**Shopping Experience Redefined**
<br>

The Online Shopping System – EZ-Shopping is a web-based application. The purpose of the application is to automate and facilitate the whole process of shopping. The objective of this project is to develop a general – purpose online shopping store through which customers can buy products from the comfort of home through the Internet. As the world responds to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we’re seeing a dramatic shift from in-person to online shopping. Consumers are relying on the digital world more than ever and businesses are forced to adapt their strategies and shift toward digital transformation with much more urgency than before. EZ-Shopping has all the facilities a user might need during online shopping. It has a variety of categories to choose from, wide ranges of products, flexible shopping cart and checkout methods. It is a multi-vendor application with separate vendor and admin portals.
